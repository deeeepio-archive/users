A dark backside covered in elaborate light spots allows the shark to blend in with the shimmering waters of the ocean when viewed from above, and a white underbelly camouflages the shark against the bright surface from below. Each whale shark's pattern is completely unique, allowing scientists to use these patterns like fingerprints to identify specific sharks.",
