They do this by suckling excess milk after they were meant to be weaned--often times by \"stealing\" the milk of female elephant seals who aren't their mother. Most of the female seals will bite away these super-weaners; Though a select few, often times former mothers who tragically lost their pups, will \"adopt\" the super-weaners due to maternal instinct.",

Both colossal females, around 5.5m/18ft to 7m/23ft long – meaning they could be even longer than the largest known great whites. Though they undeniably exist, the sharks can be considered a type of cryptid; They're known only from photos, evading any and all scientific study. Are they freak coincidences? Or a new species of eccentric leviathans? For now, it remains a mystery.",
