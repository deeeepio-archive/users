  "description": "You self proclaimed t10 “pros” are honestly pathetic. Yeah we all see you switching teams because you laid sight on another t10. Your t10 status means nothing, but i guess winning for the 17278th time with gpo and orca is still somehow fun for you guys.",
  "about": "Look, i also had an era where i actively played gpo and orca. Yes i was dominating every game, but the moment i switched animals i realised that im not actually any good. I was just playing the most busted animals.",
